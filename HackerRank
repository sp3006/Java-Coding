Given: 
, , 

Calculations: 
 
 
 

We round  to the nearest dollar (integer) and then print our result:

The total meal cost is 15 dollars.

import Java.io.*

public class Arithmetic {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        double mealCost = scan.nextDouble(); // original meal price
        int tipPercent = scan.nextInt(); // tip percentage
        int taxPercent = scan.nextInt(); // tax percentage
        scan.close();
        //System.out.println (tipPercent);
        // Write your calculation code here.
      
        // cast the result of the rounding operation to an int and save it as totalCost 
        int totalCost = (int) Math.round(mealCost + (mealCost*tipPercent/100 + mealCost * taxPercent/100));
        
        // Print your result
        System.out.println("The total meal cost is "+ totalCost + " dollars.");
    }
}
